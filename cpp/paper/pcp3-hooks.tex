\hook{STARTUP}{} Called immediately after the perl parser is initialized.
\hook{STARTPARSE}{} Called just before the bison parser is started (i.e., before yyparse()).
\hook{EXIT}{\$return\_\-exit\_\-code} Called just before the system exit() call.
\hook{HANDLE\_\-DIRECTIVE}{\$directive\_\-name} Called exactly once for each directive.  \$directive\_\-name is
% the directive as it appeared in the source code with the leading \# removed.
\hook{DO\_\-DEFINE}{\$s\_\-start,\$s\_\-end,\$name\_\-args\_\-body} Called exactly once for each \#define. 
% Arguments give the source code character offsets of the line and the 
% unprocessed rest of the line including the name of the macro, its arguments
% and its definition.
\hook{PRE\_\-DO\_\-UNDEF}{\$s\_\-start,\$s\_\-end,\$mname} Called exactly once for each \#undef.
% Arguments give the source code character offsets of the line and the
% name of the macro being undefined.  This hook is called just before
% the macro is undefined, so its definition still exists 
% in the preprocessor's state.
\hook{DO\_\-UNDEF}{\$s\_\-start,\$s\_\-end,\$mname} Called exactly once for each \#undef.
% Arguments give the source code character offsets of the line and the
% name of the macro being undefined.  This hook is called immediately after
% the macro is undefined.
\hook{DO\_\-INCLUDE}{\$filename\_\-given, \$filename\_\-resolved, \$flags} Called exactly once for each \#include,
% \#include\_\-next, or \#import directive.  \$filename\_\-given is the name of the
% file to be included as written in the source.  \$filename\_\-resolved is the
% fully qualified path name of the file to be read.  \$flags is a bitmap
% with three relevant masks:  \$ANGLE\_\-BRACKETS, for whether the filename appeared
% in angle brackets signifying a system include file; \$SKIP\_\-DIRS, for whether this
% is an \#include\_\-next directive; and \$IMPORTING, for whether this is an \#import
% directive.
\hook{DO\_\-IF}{\$conditional, \$skipped, \$value} Called exactly once for each \#if
% (not \#ifdef or \#ifndef) directive.  Arguments .... FIXGJB
