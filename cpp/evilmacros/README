FWIW, #ifdef FOO  is *not* an expansion of the macro FOO, and
      #if    FOO  is not treated as an expansion, either
i.e., ccd lines must be handled using the old mechanism for now.

How To Use Pcp3 To Preprocess A Package
---------------------------------------

0) Use Linux for the configuration; we used that for the first run of numbers.
   Your path should contain ~gjb/bin/linux/pcp3, and, from ~gjb/bin/share,
	gcc-pcp3, pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c, pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c-files-listing,
        denote-expansions, clean-for-pcp3, find-c-no-usr,
        canonicalize-paths-in-field1, pcp3-combine-expansions, and possibly other scripts.
   Set environment variable lgjb to /scratch/gjb; do one of
     setenv lgjb /scratch/gjb
     export lgjb=/scratch/gjb
   Ensure that /homes/gws/gjb/perl/site-lib/Boolean.pm appears in $PERLLIB

1) Run `./configure' or `xmkmf -a'

2) make
   This ensures that the distribution is OK, and creates any auxiliary
   files needed by the make process.
2b) clean-for-pcp3; chgrp -R macros .; chmod -R g+w .

3) Use gcc-pcp3 instead of a compiler; do one of
    * make -k CC=gcc-pcp3
    * Edit Makefiles (edit CC=gcc variable); may need to remove other
      spurious compile flags that cpp doesn't understand, e.g., -O, or -g.
      Find makefiles with "findfile Makefile"; or use
      perl -ibak and a tricky zsh pattern like **/Makefile 

4) make -k in all appropriate directories -- the link step will fail
4c) Ignore most of the make output (it's largely redefinition warnings),
    but do search for "**", which marks a pcp3 error.

5) cd to the top level directory

6) pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c
   pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c-files-listing
   # check that for every .c file, a .exps file exists

6b) For each file remaining, create the .exps file by making that .o file
        make -k CC=gcc-pcp3
    (may need to touch-oldify the .o file first).
    Do this in its own directory, not from the top-level directory.



7) pcp3-combine-expansions to create 
   # To create expansions.lst
   
8) denote-expansions expansions.lst 2> denote-expansions.err
   # (zsh syntax)
   # create munged/* directory hierarchy with preprocessed files
   # If anything went wrong here, it's *bad news*.

9) cd munged
   find-c-no-usr > c-files-listing
   # cd into munged, and create a new c-files-list
   diff =(sort c-files-listing) =(sort ../c-files-listing)
   # compare to the old c-files-listings (zsh syntax)

   "Do the right thing" with header files
   -- either copy the header file into munged/ (if it's included but has no expansions), or
   -- do nothing (if it is not included by any source file)

   find-c-no-usr >! c-files-listing
   # Regenerate c-files-listing

10) # Skip this step for now; we want to see the files in case of trouble.
    rm -fr munged/usr munged/uns
    rm -f **/*.o(.) #find . -type f -name "*.o" -exec rm \; 
    # Save space

11) run em_analyze over the munged directory and pray
