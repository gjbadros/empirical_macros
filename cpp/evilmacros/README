FWIW, #ifdef FOO  is *not* an expansion of the macro FOO, and
      #if    FOO  is not treated as an expansion, either
i.e., ccd lines must be handled using the old mechanism for now.

How To Use Pcp3 To Preprocess A Package
---------------------------------------

0) Use Linux for the configuration; we used that for the first run of numbers.
   Your path should contain ~gjb/bin/linux/pcp3, and, from ~gjb/bin/share,
     gcc-pcp3, pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c, and ossibly other scripts.
   Set environment variable lgjb to /scratch/gjb; do one of
     setenv lgjb /scratch/gjb
     export lgjb=/scratch/gjb
   Ensure that /homes/gws/gjb/perl/site-lib/Boolean.pm appears in $PERLLIB

1) Run `./configure' or `xmkmf -a'

2) make
   This ensures that the distribution is OK, and creates any auxiliary
   files needed by the make process.
2b) Use clean-for-pcp3 script which does:
         rm -f **/*.o(.)
    Or:  find . -type f -name "*.o" -exec rm \; 
    and: chgrp -R macros .; chmod -R g+w .

3) Use gcc-pcp3 instead of a compiler; do one of
    * make -k CC=gcc-pcp3
    * Edit Makefiles (edit CC=gcc variable); may need to remove other
      spurious compile flags that cpp doesn't understand, e.g., -O, or -g.
      Find makefiles with "findfile Makefile"; or use
      perl -ibak and a tricky zsh pattern like **/Makefile 

4) make -k in all appropriate directories -- the link step will fail
4b) rm -f **/*.o(.) #find . -type f -name "*.o" -exec rm \; 

5) cd to the top level directory

6) Use pcp3-compare-exps-vs-c to check to make sure we have all the
   appropriate .exps files (1 per .c file)
6b) for each file remaining, create the .exps file by making that .o file
   (may need to rm the .o file first)

7) use pcp3-combine-expansions to create expansions.lst

8) Run:

denote-expansions expansions.lst 2>denote-expansions.err

to create munged/* directory hierarchy with preprocessed files

9) cd into munged, and create a new c-files-list and
compare to the old c-files-listings:
find-c-no-usr >c-files-listing
diff =(sort c-files-listing) =(sort ../c-files-listing)    #zsh-syntax

"Do the right thing" with header files
-- either copy the header file into munged/ (if it's included but has no expansions), or
-- do nothing (if it is not included by any source file)

Regenerate c-files-listing:
find-c >c-files-listing


10) rm -fr munged/usr munged/uns


11) run em_analyze over the munged directory and pray
