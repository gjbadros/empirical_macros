     "An Empirical Analysis of C Preprocessor Use"
     
     Thank you for your submission to Transactions on Software Engineering.  You 
     will receive a formal acknowledgment letter after an Associate Editor has 
     been assigned to your paper.
     
     The length of the review process for a particular paper varies, since many 
     factors can affect the process.  The time it takes for an Associate Editor 
     to be assigned, and for qualified referees to be located who are available 
     to handle the review of a paper can be several months, depending on the 
     complexity and type of material.
     
     Accordingly, please allow at least four months for the review 
     process to be completed.  We will let you know as soon as a decision is 
     made.
     
     Please contact me if you have any questions.
     
     Sincerely,
