Greg wondered which line of gcc has an expansion dependent on the
expansions of 187 macros.  (This is an outlier:  of the 297760 lines in
gcc, only 13 are expansion-dependent on more than 100 macros -- all of
which fall in the range of 159 to 187 such dependences.)

It's this one, whose mere appearance in the final source is dependent on
182 macros (not such an outlier: over 10,000 lines are inclusion-dependent
on more than that many macros):

gcc-2.7.2.1/explow.c:430: dependences incl=182; exp=187; either=356
      LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (x, oldx, mode, win);

LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS is defined 30 times in gcc, and one randomly-selected
definition was 37 line long (and chock full of other macro invocations).
