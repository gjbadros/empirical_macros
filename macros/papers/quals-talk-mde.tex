\begin{note}
Please interrupt to ask questions.

Goal: better understand how the preprocessor is used.  (It can be used in a
disciplined, limited way to reduce programmer effort and improve
readability, readability, and performance.   Or, it can almost obliterate
the code.  Which do people use in practice?)  (Answer: both; there is good
news and bad news, no matter what your goals.)

(Tiberius Caesar; his son and successor Gaius; 
Naevius Macro was head of his Praetorian Guard;
Tacitus states in the {\em Annals}, ``By AD 37, the influence of Macro was
supreme''; I think 1,960 years is long enough.)

\slidetitle{Who cares?}

Language designers

Tool writers

Programmers

Software engineers
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Language designers: see what's missing, see what people do via macros and
Cpp, figure out how to support it (or prevent it!) \slbreak
Think more about this:  Also, how do language choices lead to more/less
tightly integrated (as opposed to open, component-based) environments?
E.G., no need for \verb|__LINE__| in Java?

Tool writers: understand how people use Cpp; learn to recognize and cope
with those constructs. \slbreak
Translator \& other macro tool writers:  Is this a reasonable task?  Is it a
non-trivial task?

Programmers: see how to avoid constructs that give tools fits.  Or, learn
weird new tricks!

Software engineers: This has never been done before -- try it and see
what's interesting.  This may seem straightforward, but we discovered some
interesting results; both good and bad news.  [Briefly mention (lack of)
related work here?]

Cpp is essential
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item file inclusion
\item define constants and macros
\item conditional compilation
\end{itemize}

Cpp is hard to reason about
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
(Say ``C preprocessor'' on this slide.)

Macros are an extra-language feature without which C is incomplete: you
can't write a C program without Cpp.

Hard for both tools and people to reason about. \slbreak
A ``C program'' isn't really C, so existing tools don't help. \slbreak
Macros can expand to anything you want --- very arbitrary.

\slidetitle{Coping with Cpp}

Ignore it

Preprocess into Cpp-free C code
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item program must parse
\item tool and human see different inputs
\item loss of information
\item one configuration, not whole program

\end{slide}

\begin{note}
\vspace{-40pt} % To make this note fit on one page.
{\small
I'm talking about both humans and tools, but with an emphasis on tools.

Ignoring Cpp is acceptable (only) for approximate tools.

Problems with pre-processing:
\vspace{-.3in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item syntactic: what about porting, maintenance?
\item tool input is not what user sees; back mappings are imperfect (and
  some tools don't even try)
\item loss of information:
% \vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
  \item {\tt \#define}s don't appear in symbol table
  \item less documentation (e.g., types on constants and functions)
  \item can't trace or break on macros; can do so for inline functions
\end{itemize}
\item can only reason about one specialization or configuration, not about
  the program as a whole
\end{itemize}

Operate on un-preprocessed code: \slbreak
ambitious and difficult, so we did this. \slbreak
(Complicated preprocessor use, complicated mappings between original and processed.)
}
\end{note}

\begin{slide}
\slidetitle{Coping with Cpp, continued}

Test for, perhaps annotate, tricky uses

Eliminate in favor of {\tt const}, {\tt inline}, templates, reference
parameters


\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Like macro lint.

Elimination does away all the problems listed above, because tools can
already deal with regular C code.  We can do this via a source-to-source
translation.  (This was my real motivation.)
\end{note}


\begin{slide}
\slidetitle{Cpp: not all bad}

Language extensions

No dependence on compiler

Some tools exist
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Can define entirely new syntax, avoid repetition, do other things the
language doesn't let you do.  [more examples here!]

No compiler dependence:
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item inlining (probably -- watch out for recursion, etc.)
\item constant-folding
\item fold away branches
\end{itemize}
Should trust the compiler more than the programmer most (not all) of the time

Tool examples: Emacs hide-ifdef mode

There are killer apps for Cpp: 
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
 \item conditional compilation (esp. system dependencies)
 \item declarations (writing two different languages in one source code)
 \item repetitive constructs
\end{itemize}

Lots of Cpp use

Lots of variation
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Lots of Cpp use ($\frac{1}{8}$ more than 21\%)

Lots of variation (see next slide for details)

Heavy Cpp users:
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item glibc: lots of {\tt \#include}, many small files (avg.~42 lines)
\item gzip: lots of literals, lots of system calls
\item remind: {\tt \#define} for all output, checks of \verb|HAVE_PROTO|
\item bash: many tests for availability of system services
\end{itemize}

{\tt \#undef} almost always precedes a definition, to avoid warnings

{\tt \#line} appears only in lex and yacc output (for bootstrapping, or
when they aren't available)

Notice ``other'' is in the noise -- Cpp is really only used for include,
define, and conditionals (duh).

\raisedslidetitle{Definitions per Cpp identifier}

\centerline{\epsfig{file=num-defs.eps,height=6in}}

Many macros multiply defined

Few macros defined very many times
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Surprising: so many definitions for so many macros.  But the tail is pretty
short.

Basically good news.

When multiple defs, they often (not always) have same type or same effect
on parser state.  (Maybe refer to a later analysis (categorization by macro
identifier rather than by macro definition), if I can do it in time.)
\end{note}

\begin{slide}
\raisedslidetitle{Expansions per Cpp macro}

\centerline{\epsfig{file=num-uses.eps,height=6in}}

Many macros never used \slbreak
Many macros used many times
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
The interesting data are at the extrema:  pretty many not used, and tail is
very long.  Notice the scaling of the bottom axis (go to a log scale??)

5\% unused [check that number] is pretty high.

glibc is a library, so it isn't surprising that it defines many macros it
never uses itself -- they're intended for external consumption.
\end{note}

\begin{slide}
\slidetitle{Where macros are used}

\centerline{\epsfig{file=how-used.eps,height=6in}}

Few macros used in both Cpp and code
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\slidetitle{Categorization}

Null define: {\tt \#define \verb|HAVE_PROTO|}

Constant: {\tt \#define \verb|ARG_MAX| 131072} \slbreak
{\tt \#define \verb|RED_COLS| (1 << \verb|RED_BITS|)}

Expression: {\tt \#define sigmask(x) (1 << ((x)-1))}

Statement: {\tt \#define FREE(s) if (s) free (s);}

Stringization and pasting: \slbreak
  {\tt \#define \verb|__CONCAT|(x,y) x \#\# y}

Other syntactic macros: {\tt \#define AND ;} \slbreak
  {\tt \#define private static}

Failed classification: \slbreak
  {\tt \#define \verb|SYSDEP_CFLAGS| -q \verb|no_sl_enable|}
\end{slide}

\begin{note}
This is the only place where previous work is at all applicable.
(Their categorizations sometimes focussed on constructs that don't happen
all that often or missed ones that are actually frequent.)

\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item Null define: can be in Cpp or in code (get private = static or nothing)
\item Constant: includes literals
\item Expression: might be constant or might have different value.  Like a
function not returning void.
\item Statement: like a function returning void.
\item Stringization and pasting: uses arg as text
\item Other syntactic macros: e.g. private = static, partial declarations
\item Failed classification: more partial declarations
\end{itemize}

\end{note}

\begin{slide}
\raisedslidetitle{Macro body categorizations}

\centerline{\epsfig{file=category.eps,height=6in}}

Most are simple \slbreak
Many are complicated

\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Good news and bad: \slbreak
most are simple:  simple for me to cope with, simple for other tools as
well (so no need for someone clever to worry about all this) \slbreak
There are few bad ones percentagewise, but many numerically, and they are
the tough ones, after all.
\end{note}


\begin{slide}
\slidetitle{Future work}

Parse more C:  typedefs, structs, precedence.

Macro lint:
\vspace{-.5in}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
\item side effects
\item semicolon swallowing
\item free variables
\item more...
\end{itemize}

Infer types

Translate

Partially specify macro values

Macro dependence structure/lattice

\end{slide}

\begin{note}
Perhaps this is the time to discuss the tool (not a very interesting
topic).

Side effects: if actual has side effect and formal used multiple times; if
body has side effect, can't be a const (but can be turned into a formal, and
maybe the compiler will be able to figure something out)

Infer types:
 can't know real types without knowledge of architecture
 the type of zero
 polymorphism

Translation:
 macros can go where functions can't, like case labels
 the enum hack
 idiomatic C++, e.g. use of bool, enum.  (Just a tool that introduced bool
     would be quite nice...)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
Polymorphism:
2 cases where macros provide polymorphism:
 * type argument
 * use of ad-hoc polymorphism inherited from underlying operators, e.g.
     min works on both floats \& ints, or both shorts \& longs (the latter
     can't be converted to long w/o loss of efficiency)
Can't capture this without templates -- can't even tell when it is
really being used, though could avoid doing some type promotion (say,
beyond int or unsigned int).
Macros too relaxed, too polymorphic (e.g. can pass char to ABS macro, but
that wasn't intended; on the other hand, same thing happens for a function,
right?).  The translation will indicate this.  Do we want a
template or just specific types?
Making every macro into a template function works well, because the calls
don't change, just the definitions.  (But declarations in the body might
change, so it involves parsing and rewriting the body, not just the
declaration.  And, what is the return type?)
