An Empirical Analysis of C Preprocessor Use

3: Motivation (approaches, too?)
* Cpp complicates program artifacts because it is unstructured
* Tools then must deal with complexity somehow
  + Ignore the preprocessor
  + Accept only post-processed code
     -- Most common approach but has big problems (see next figure)
  + Embed the preprocessor's functionality
* Need to understand better how people use cpp

4: Code Before and After Cpp (what compiler sees, what sde sees)
Wat you see is not what the compiler gets!


5: Our framework overview 
* 6400 line perl script
* runs over entire packages
* looks at preprocessor directives,
* macro definitions and uses
* >1,000,000 lines of code
