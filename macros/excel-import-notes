1) do 'make clean; make copy' from data/ directory

2) start excel (works well w/ WinDD -- not tested thorougly w/ Hydraw)

3) Load macros/papers/emp-use-all-charts.xls

4) Permit "Enable Macros"

5) Control page up repeatedly to ensure you're on the first sheet

6) Alt-F8 to bring up the list of defined macros

7) Run "OpenFiles" macro which gets a bunch of data files from g:\macros\papers
  -> make sure g: is mounted properly

8) go back to emp-use-all-charts.xls file using window -> more windows menu

9) for each sheet in e-a-c.xls, copy from corresponding window (one of the files imported by the macro)
   (file 'tbl-package-sizes-with-uses' corresponds to uses-per-line excel sheet)
   (drop column "D" of tbl-ccd-categories -- should be all zeros)
   (dep-byline chart, unhide columns b,c,d before pasting, then re-hide them)
  a) Ctrl-Home, Ctrl-Shift-End, Ctrl-C  (sometimes you have to delete an all-zeros  column before copying)
  b) switch back to emp-use-all-charts.xls
  c) MOVE TO RIGHT PLACE -- sometimes NOT paste over 1st or 1st & 2nd rows
  d) Paste with Ctrl-V (or ENTER)
  e) watch numbers change, use Ctrl-Z to undo if bad
  f) Now look for random instructions on worksheet and follow them.
  g) Update last pasted time
  h) Delete window of opened files as they are used

10) Do not try to updated sheets with "(obsoleted)" in their sheet name (I edited the macro to not load
   those data files, and they may have other problems)

11) Ctrl-p to print a graph to psc2es, Ctrl-Shift-P to print a graph to a file (will be prompted for name)
