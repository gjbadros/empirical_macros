Title: A Framework for Preprocessor-Aware C Source Code Analyses
Author: Greg J. Badros and David Notkin

Abstract:

Analyses of C source code usually ignore the C preprocessor because of
its complexity.  Instead, these analyses either define their own
approximate parser (or scanner) or else they require that their input
already be preprocessed.   Neither approach is entirely satisfactory:
the first gives up accuracy (or incurs large implementation costs),
while the second loses the preprocessor-based abstractions.  We describe
a framework that permits analyses to be expressed in terms of both
preprocessing and parsing actions, allowing the implementer to focus on
the analysis of interest while still handling preprocessing information.
We discuss an implementation of
such a framework that embeds a C preprocessor, a parser, and a Perl
interpreter for the action "hooks."  Many common software engineering
analyses can be implemented surprisingly easily using this framework,
replacing numerous ad-hoc tools.  The framework's integration of the
preprocessor and the parser further enables some analyses that
otherwise would be especially difficult to perform.
