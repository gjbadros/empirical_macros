\opening{Dear Editor:}

Enclosed please find our latest version of ``A Framework for
Preprocessor-Aware C Source Code Analyses'' by Badros and Notkin, which we
have revised based on the comments of the two referees.

Our revisions addressed referee A's single concern, about the late
mention of the name of the tool (\pcp{}), by adding a mention of the
tool and its name to the very beginning of section 2.

We address referee B's concerns as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \pcp{} is now available via ftp (instead of ``available from
      authors upon email request'').  We give the URL at the beginning
      of section 4.
\item WE NEED TO ADD ANOTHER EXAMPLE
\item We integrated a shortened section 3.4 into section 3.1 since the
      Emacs mode mostly targets that analysis.  We feel it is an
      important and useful application of the framework, but did revise
      it to be less detached and more coupled to the text in section 3.1 
      to which it is most closely related.  This revision also enhances that
      example and makes it more compelling and complete.
\end{itemize}

Other minor revisions to aid in publication of our paper that we made
include:

\begin{itemize}
\item double-spacing of the paper
\item updating the date
\item eliminating C++ and cpp as keywords so there are only six
\item revising the references list so that they are ordered numerically
      in order of appearance
\item using unnumbered section headings, and rewording section references
\item renaming section 4 to ``\pcp{} Tool Details'' from ``The \pcp{}
      Tool''
\item eliminating mention of the color red in figure 5; and
\item inclusion of figures as separate pages instead of in-body.
\end{itemize}

We look forward to an expeditious publication in the journal.  Please
let us know if we can assist in any way.
    
\closing{Best regards,}
