* ICSE PCP^3 paper
** Extensible Preprocessing: A Framework for Source Code Analyses
** Analyses to attempt
*** pre vs. post processed code mapping (emacs-based ui from quals paper)
*** conservatively marking identifiers that might be macro expanded
*** call graph extractor (just because)
*** global variable uses (some hidden inside macros, etc.)
*** inter-file dependency minimization (not sure what pcp3 buys me here)
**** headers
**** globals
*** etags definition extractor
**** do not need to give regexps
*** code metrics (e.g., ncnb lines, complexity measures)
